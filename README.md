my CV, in FAQ format:  

Q - *how much time do you spend per week on actual coding?*  
A - maybe 20 hours a week, I've never had a job that was only coding  

Q - *and how much time do you spend on back-end code vs. front-end code?*  
A - 90% back-end / 10% front-end

A - for the web systems it's C# and WCF on the back-end, with Web API and Angular on the front-end  
A - newer tools are in C# and WPF  
A - older tools were in Python and Tk  

Q - *what do you do in the other 20 something hours?*  
A - networks, systems, security, design, copywriting, the usual Mr. Robot activities  
A - but with less morphine and more Claritin  

Q - *design and copy, they have digital agencies for that sort of, flimflammery, you know?*  
A - yes, they used an agency for the company website, [and it's still good for a laugh](https://www.adweek.com/creativity/vince-vaughn-and-costars-pose-idiotic-stock-photos-you-can-have-free-163239/)  
A - for technical copy I write in standard technical English, which is similar to writing for translation  
A - for human copy I'm always shoplifting ideas from places like the MailChimp [style guide](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/) and [voice and tone guide](http://voiceandtone.com/)  

Q - *what were the last projects that you worked on alone?*  
A - (many) data transformation tools  

Q - *what were the last projects that you worked on in a team?*  
A - a web service maintenance project, I added the changes to the web service library (assigned to me because I originally made the library), and someone else added the changes to the UI  
A - a proof of concept for integration with an enterprise stack, I made the message queue library, someone else made the web service library and the UI

Q - *and how big is the software team?*  
A - 4 people when I started, 8 people now  
A - but I also work on-site with banks and insurers, last year I was at FNB / RMB every other day

Q - *so, what is good code?*  
A - code that doesn't make me think, organising the structure of a software project is essentially the same information design problem as every other information design problem  

Q - *do you use any unit tests or automated tests?*  
A - no, automated testing is outsourced to another company  

Q - *do you use virtualization?*  
A - not for live servers  
A - VMware for the penetration testing environment (Kali) and disaster recovery test environment (Windows Server)  

Q - *do you use containers?*  
A - no  

Q - *do you use continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI / CD)?*  
A - no, it's financial software, banks can take months to test a single version  

Q - *do you use Agile?*  
A - every client has their own interpretation of Agile, we try to use whatever each client uses, but the definition of Agile changes whenever there's a new project manager  
A - okay, okay, “scrum master”  

Q - *how do you get things done / what project management tools do you use?*  
A - everyone in the company uses FogBugz to track what to do  
A - I use John Carmack's .plan file format to track what was done  

Q - *why do you duplicate your work across two systems?*  
A - FogBugz only tracks official requests, which is maybe a quarter of what I do  
A - you can think of .plan files as a private Twitter feed of what you've just finished working on  

Q - *what version control system do you use?*  
A - mainly SVN, with GitHub for outside contractors  

Q - *how do you keep your skills up to date?*  
A - I watch ArsDigita videos (Shai Simonson is an underappreciated genius), Robert Sedgewick videos, Programming with Mosh videos, CBT Nuggets videos, etc.  
A - right now I'm watching the theory of computation videos by Shai Simonson  

Q - *what is the most difficult / challenging part of your current job / last job?*  
A - managing up / influence without authority  

Q - *so, business comes over to your desk and is busy talking you into an ugly hack that will add a ton of technical debt, what do you do?*  
A - express concern, act surprised, deny everything  
A - but seriously, technical debt can be thought of as an abstraction for defrauding the company over time  

Q - *what is your biggest weakness?*  
A - physically, all of my back injuries, the heaviest item that I can lift is a gaming laptop, I need to use an ergonomic keyboard, an ergonomic mouse, and an ergonomic chair, and I can't be part of any activity more physically demanding than a walk to the nearest café  
A - no, my condition is not from Fight Club  
A - yes, that is what a Fight Club veteran would say  

Q - *and your biggest strength?*  
A - subjectively, people often ask me to write things for them  
A - objectively, you can have a look at my [Big Five psychometric test results](https://bigfive-test.com/result/5b4b11be7a90d1005389026d)  
A - tl;dr - high openness and consciousness, average extraversion and agreeableness, low neuroticism  

Q - *C# vs. Java vs. PHP*  
A - Visual Studio and C# are the only things that Microsoft has done right in recent history (no, Halo was made by Bungie, not Microsoft)

Q - *vi vs. Emacs*  
A - nano, **like a normal person**  
A - otherwise Notepad++, Sublime Text, and Brackets  
A - Notepad++ for the save-as-admin plugin to update config files that live somewhere protected, i.e. under \Program Files\ or \Program Files (x86)\ or \inetpub\wwwroot\  

Q - *Google Cloud Platform vs. Amazon Web Services vs. Microsoft Azure vs. DigitalOcean*  
A - Google is the least painful to use, Microsoft is the most painful to use  
A - [ethically, Amazon is in last place](https://gizmodo.com/reminder-amazon-treats-its-employees-like-shit-1792642652)  
A - [I must still try DigitalOcean, I want to use it for my own Algo VPN](https://zeltser.com/deploy-algo-vpn-digital-ocean/)  

Q - *Windows vs. macOS vs. Linux vs. BSD*  
A - BSD for firewalls, Linux for servers, macOS for desktops  
A - BSD over Linux for firewalls because it has native ipfw, pf, and npf, and based on past experience BSD will only go down if the hardware explodes, a handy feature for a box that's assumed to be carrier grade  

Q - *Red Hat vs. Debian*  
A - Red Hat from 1999 till it got unbearable, then Ubuntu LTS till it got unbearable, and now Alpine and Kali and Parrot  
A - Alpine originally because it was light-enough to be fast-enough in VirtualBox on my old Pentium 4, now because it's light-enough to run at the speed of light on my late 2014 Mac mini

Q - *how do you pronounce Linux?*  
A - depends on how aggressively the other person is pronouncing it  

Q - *MySQL vs. PostgreSQL vs. SQL Server vs. Sybase vs. Oracle vs. IBM*  
A - I only care about having clear and consistent table and column naming conventions  
A - but DB2 does have the most complete implementation of ANSI SQL, which gives you luxuries like INTERSECT  

Q - *Intel vs. AMD vs. Arm*  
A - if this is an assembly language question then TI MSP430  
A - [MSP430 assembler is easier to understand than some popular scripting languages](http://robotics.hobbizine.com/asmlau.html)

Q - *what do you do on the weekend?*  
A - hamburgers (#1 - the rib eye beef burger at Aroma)  
A - coffee (#1 - Proof Cafe, the first shop outside the Gautrain station in Sandton)

Q - *what are you passionate about?*  
A - good art direction, good copywriting, good design in general  

Q - *what are you inversely passionate about?*  
A - database administration is a hate crime
