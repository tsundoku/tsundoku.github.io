my CV, in FAQ format:  

Q - how much time do you spend per week on actual coding?  
A - altogether maybe 20 hours a week, I've never had a job that was only coding  

Q - what else do you do?  
A - networks, systems, security, design, copywriting  

Q - how much time do you spend on back-end code vs. front-end code?  
A - 90% back-end / 10% front-end  

Q - and what do you use for that code?  
A - for the system it's C# and WCF on the back-end, with ASP.NET, WebAPI, and Angular on the front-end  
A - for new tools it's C# and WPF, some olders tools are still in Python or Ruby  

Q - what were the last projects that you worked on alone?  
A - (many) data transformation projects, implemented as WPF apps in C#  
A - an automated penetration testing tool, but we might scrap that and just use McAfee since they're an authorised scanning vendor (ASV) for payment card industry certification (PCI DSS)

Q - what were the last projects that you worked on in a team?  
A - a web service maintenance project, I added the changes to the web service library (assigned to me because I originally made the library), someone else added the UI changes  
A - an integration project, I made the message queue library, someone else made the web service library and the UI

Q - how big was the software team at your current job / last job?  
A - small teams only, between 4 and 8 people  
A - but I've also worked on-site with banks and insurers, e.g. last year I was at FNB/RMB every other day

Q - so, what is good code?  
A - code that doesn't make me think, organising the structure of a software project is essentially the same information design problem as every other information design problem  

Q - do you use any unit tests or automated tests?  
A - no, automated testing is (more or less) outsourced to another company  

Q - do you use virtualization?  
A - not for live servers  
A - VMware for the penetration testing environment (Kali) and disaster recovery test environment (Windows Server 2012 R2)  
A - I had originally set it up on Hyper-V, but having to set up your own virtual network scared some of the developers, so I switched everything to VMware

Q - do you use containers?  
A - no  

Q - do you use continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI / CD)  
A - no, it's financial software, banks take weeks or months to test a single version  

Q - do you use Agile?  
A - every client has their own interpretation of Agile, we try to use whatever each client uses, but the definition of Agile changes whenever there's a new project manager  
A - okay, okay, “scrum master”  

Q - how do you get things done / what project management tools do you use?  
A - everyone in the company uses FogBugz to track what to do  
A - I use John Carmack's .plan file format to track what was done  

Q - why do you duplicate your work across two systems?  
A - FogBugz only tracks official requests, which is maybe a quarter of what I do  

Q - what version control system do you use?  
A - mainly SVN, with Git for some side projects  

Q - how do you keep your skills up to date?  
A - I watch ArsDigita videos (Shai Simonson is an underappreciated genius), Robert Sedgewick videos, Programming with Mosh videos, CBT Nuggets videos, etc.  
A - right now I'm watching the theory of computation videos by Shai Simonson  

Q - what is the most difficult / challenging part of your current job / last job?  
A - managing up / influence without authority  

Q - so, business comes over to your desk and is busy talking you into an ugly hack that will add a ton of technical debt, what do you do?  
A - express concern, act surprised, deny everything  
A - a couple of years ago, absolutely anything to keep the business running  
A - now, absolutely any zero debt solution to keep the business running  

Q - what is your biggest weakness?  
A - physically, all of my back injuries, the heaviest item that I can lift is a gaming laptop, I need to use an ergonomic keyboard, an ergonomic mouse, and an ergonomic chair, and I can't be part of any activity more physically demanding than a walk to the nearest café  
A - no, my condition is not from Fight Club  
A - yes, that is probably what someone would say on the way back from Fight Club  

Q - and your biggest strength?  
A - subjectively, people do often ask me to write things for them  
A - objectively, you can have a look at my [Big Five psychometric test results](https://bigfive-test.com/result/5b4b11be7a90d1005389026d)  
A - tl;dr - high openness and consciousness, average extraversion and agreeableness, low neuroticism  

Q - C# vs. Java vs. PHP  
A - Visual Studio and C# are the only things that Microsoft has done right in recent history (no, Halo was made by Bungie, not Microsoft)

Q - vi vs. Emacs  
A - nano, **like a normal person**  
A - otherwise Notepad++, Sublime Text, and Brackets  
A - Notepad++ is nice for the save-as-admin plugin to update config files that live somewhere protected, i.e. under \Program Files\ or \Program Files (x86)\ or \inetpub\wwwroot\  

Q - Google Cloud Platform vs. Amazon Web Services vs. Microsoft Azure  
A - Google is the least painful to use, Microsoft is (by far) the most painful to use  
A - no, Google wins, flawless victory, do or do not, Microsoft didn't even try  
A - and Amazon treats their employees like “but what if the slave consents?” was a perfectly valid option, so, ethically, they're not an option  

Q - Windows vs. macOS vs. Linux vs. BSD  
A - BSD for firewalls, Linux for servers, macOS for desktops  
A - Linux is nice for servers, but BSD has native ipfw, pf, and npf, and based on past experience BSD will only go down if the hardware literally explodes  

Q - Red Hat vs. Debian  
A - Red Hat from 1999 till it got unbearable, then Ubuntu LTS till it got unbearable, and now Alpine and Kali and Parrot  
A - Alpine originally because it was light-enough to be fast-enough in VirtualBox on my old Pentium 4, now because it's light-enough to run at the speed of light on my late 2014 Mac mini

Q - how do you pronounce Linux?  
A - depends on how aggressively the other person is pronouncing it  

Q - MySQL vs. PostgreSQL vs. SQL Server vs. Sybase vs. Oracle vs. IBM  
A - I only care about having clear and consistent table and column naming conventions  
A - but DB2 does have the most complete implementation of ANSI SQL  

Q - Intel vs. AMD vs. Arm  
A - if this is an assembly language question then TI MSP430  
A - [MSP430 assembler is easier to understand than some popular scripting languages](http://robotics.hobbizine.com/asmlau.html)

Q - what do you do on the weekend?  
A - hamburgers (#1 - the rib eye beef burger at Aroma)  
A - coffee (#1 - Proof Cafe, the first shop outside the Gautrain station in Sandton)  

Q - what are you passionate about?  
A - good art direction, good copywriting, good design in general  

Q - what are you inversely passionate about?  
A - database administration is a hate crime
